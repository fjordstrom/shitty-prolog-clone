# A shitty incomplete Prolog clone with shitty XML parser included

Using [Angular Seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) as base, since I'm too lazy to start a project from scratch.


The XML parser is in `app/components/services/xml-parser.js`

The shitty Prolog clone is in  `app/components/services/pseudo-prolog-machine.js`

`npm install` to install deps, `npm start` to start it.

Go to `localhost:8000/app` to see it.
